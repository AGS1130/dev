Welcome to my blog! This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career and interests - especially on the technical side of things.

I’m a Front End Developer located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles. I currently work at [Procore Technologies](https://www.procore.com/), where I develop and maintain projects under the Marketing Department. A passionate Front End Developer with 3+ years of experience I build all aspects of user experience and user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
